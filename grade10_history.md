## 1. Historical Background
In the early 16th century, Sri Lanka was a prosperous island located on the main East-West sea trade route. The country was politically divided into three main kingdoms:
1.  **Kingdom of Kotte:** The primary kingdom in the southwest.
2.  **Kingdom of Kandy:** Located in the central highlands.
3.  **Kingdom of Jaffna:** Located in the north.

There were also smaller chieftaincies known as *Vanniyar* lands.

## 2. Arrival of the Portuguese (1505)
The Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka by accident in **1505**.
* **Leader:** [Lorenço de Almeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louren%C3%A7o_de_Almeida)
* **Reason:** They were chasing Moorish (Muslim) trading ships near the Maldives and were blown off course by a storm to the Galle harbor.
* **First Landing:** Although they drifted to Galle, they eventually anchored in **Colombo**.

### The "Parangiya Kotte Giya Wage" Incident
When the Portuguese envoys wanted to meet the King of Kotte, the locals took them on a long, circuitous route to hide the proximity of the capital (Kotte) from the Colombo harbor. The villagers, hearing the Portuguese cannon fire, famously said the foreigners were "eating stones and drinking blood" (referring to bread and wine). This event gave birth to the Sinhala idiom *"Parangiya Kotte Giya Wage"* (Like the Portuguese went to Kotte), meaning to take a long, unnecessary route to a nearby destination.

## 3. The Treaty of 1505
Lorenço de Almeida met with **King Dharma Parakramabahu IX** (the ruler of Kotte at the time). A trade agreement was formed:
* **Portuguese Promise:** To protect the King and the Kingdom from enemies and to patrol the coast.
* **Kotte's Promise:** To provide 400 *bahars* of cinnamon annually as a tribute.

## 4. Political Changes in Kotte
The arrival of the Portuguese coincided with internal conflicts in Kotte, particularly the **"Wijayaba Kollaya"** (The Spoliation of Vijayabahu) in 1521.
* Three sons of King Vijayabahu VI killed their father and divided the kingdom.
    * **Buwanekabahu VII:** Received the Kingdom of Kotte (ruled near the coast).
    * **Mayadunne:** Received the Kingdom of Sitawaka.
    * **Raigam Bandara:** Received the Principality of Raigama.

**Conflict:** Mayadunne (Sitawaka) wanted to conquer Kotte. King Buwanekabahu VII sought Portuguese military help to protect his throne, which increased Portuguese influence in local politics.

## 5. Impact of Portuguese Rule
The Portuguese eventually controlled the maritime provinces (coastal areas) for roughly 150 years (1505–1658).

### Administrative Changes
* They maintained the local administrative structure (Disava, Korale, Atapattu) but placed Portuguese officials at the top.
* Introduced the **Tombo** system (Land Registers) to collect taxes efficiently.

### Cultural and Social Impact
* **Religion:** Introduction of Roman Catholicism. Many locals converted, sometimes for privileges or due to force.
* **Language:** Many Portuguese words entered the Sinhala language (e.g., *Kamisa* - Shirt, *Mes* - Socks, *Almari* - Cupboard, *Istoppu* - Veranda).
* **Cuisine:** Introduction of chili, bread (*paan*), and temperate vegetables.
* **Clothing:** Influence on dress styles (Western attire).
