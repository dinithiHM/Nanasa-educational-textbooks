# Grade 10 Science - Photosynthesis

## What is Photosynthesis?

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

### Requirements for Photosynthesis

The three main requirements are:
- **Sunlight**: Provides energy for the process
- **Water**: Absorbed from the roots  
- **Carbon Dioxide**: Taken from the air through stomata

### The Process

1. Plants absorb sunlight through chlorophyll (the green pigment in leaves)
2. Water is absorbed from the soil through the roots
3. Carbon dioxide is taken from the air through tiny pores called stomata
4. These combine in the presence of sunlight to produce glucose (food) and oxygen

### Chemical Equation

The chemical equation for photosynthesis is:

```
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
```

This means: 6 molecules of carbon dioxide + 6 molecules of water + light energy produces 1 molecule of glucose + 6 molecules of oxygen

### Products of Photosynthesis

- **Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)**: This is the food that plants make. It provides energy for growth and other activities.
- **Oxygen (O₂)**: This is released into the atmosphere and is used by animals and humans for breathing.

### Importance of Photosynthesis

1. **Food Production**: Plants produce their own food which becomes food for other organisms
2. **Oxygen Supply**: Provides oxygen needed for breathing by animals and humans
3. **Carbon Dioxide Removal**: Removes CO₂ from the atmosphere, helping to reduce global warming
4. **Energy Source**: The glucose produced is the basis of most food chains on Earth

## Where Does Photosynthesis Occur?

Photosynthesis occurs in the **chloroplasts** of plant cells. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, which gives plants their green color and captures light energy.

### Structure of a Leaf

The leaf is specially adapted for photosynthesis:
- **Large surface area**: To capture maximum sunlight
- **Thin structure**: Allows gases to diffuse easily
- **Stomata**: Tiny pores for gas exchange
- **Veins**: Transport water and nutrients

## Factors Affecting Photosynthesis

### 1. Light Intensity
- More light increases the rate of photosynthesis (up to a point)
- In darkness, photosynthesis cannot occur

### 2. Carbon Dioxide Concentration
- Higher CO₂ concentration increases photosynthesis rate
- Plants need adequate CO₂ from the air

### 3. Temperature
- Photosynthesis works best at moderate temperatures (25-35°C)
- Too hot or too cold slows down the process

### 4. Water Availability
- Plants need water for photosynthesis
- Lack of water reduces photosynthesis

### 5. Chlorophyll Content
- More chlorophyll means more light absorption
- Healthy green leaves photosynthesize better

## Examples in Daily Life

- **Rice paddies** in Sri Lanka: Rice plants use photosynthesis to grow and produce rice grains
- **Coconut trees**: Use photosynthesis to produce coconuts and coconut water
- **Kitchen gardens**: Vegetables like beans, tomatoes, and leafy greens all use photosynthesis

## Summary

Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth. It:
- Converts light energy into chemical energy (glucose)
- Produces oxygen for breathing
- Forms the base of food chains
- Helps regulate atmospheric CO₂ levels

Remember: **6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂**
